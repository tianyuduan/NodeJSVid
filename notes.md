#node js
javascript runtime uses V8 javascript engine, same uses as google chomre

allows us to RUN JS as on the server

builds very fast, scalable real-time

event driven, nonblocking i-O model

manifules files on the file system
build web servers

query database

powerful APIs, backend interfaces

node is ascyc and nonblocking,

node js follows the eventloop, it saves time, can do stuff while files are uploading and not blocked

DOM- document object model

use dom when interact with web pages -add content, delete change on html document

docuemnt is just the webpage
every html elment is an object
the Model describe all the elements that are laid out

mongoose and node js very scalable

express- web framework to build application with node js
-creating routes , templtes, etc faster

nodemon- kinda like webpack, constantly watches and updates routes

express- essentially a serious a middle function calls


handlebars - template engine
express handlebars
kinda the same idea as react

layout bascially wraps around all the other handlebars
